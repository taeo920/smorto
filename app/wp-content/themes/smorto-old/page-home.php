		<li>
			<h2>What I Do</h2>
			<p>I create robust, effective, and usable websites. Primarily I am a developer - and a versitile one at that. I speak many languages including ASP.Net(C#), CSS, JavaScript(jQuery), PHP, SQL, and XHTML. I am a ninja when it comes to my platform of choice, <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.</p>
			<p>I like to think of development as more than just ones and zeros - it is a creative process. I enjoy finding ways to make my code more efficient, more semantic, and easier to read.</p>
			<p>I suppose it helps then that I consider myself as a bit of a designer as well.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Where I Work</h2>
			<p>Since June of 2010 I have been employed as a web developer by <a href="http://www.webershandwick.com/Default.aspx/GlobalNetwork/TheAmericas/UnitedStates/Baltimore">Weber Shandwick</a> - a leading global PR agency. At the Baltimore office our relatively small group of strategists, designers, and code-monkeys works with several very high profile clients such as American Airlines, BGE, HP, Kraft, Samsung, and PepsiCo.</p>
			<p>I work full time at Weber but I occasionally find time to engage in freelance work. If you would be interested in working with me on a project please <a href="/contact">let me know!</a></p>
		</li>

			<h2>Who I Am</h2>
			<p>In case the 90pt font above didn't catch your eye, my name is Steve Morton. I live in Baltimore, Maryland with my wife <a href="http://www.nikkicorsair.net/">Nikki</a>.</p>
			<p>I'm a huge dork so I typically spend my time watching anime, sci-fi, and of course playing lots of video games. I love RPGs (MMORPGs in particular) but have been known to rack up killing sprees in FPSs as well.</p>
			<p>As you might expect I don't get out terribly much but when I do you can expect to find me at anime conventions, rennaisance festivals, and the occasional indie rock show.</p>
